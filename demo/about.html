            <p>
		It's fresher, better tasting, and helps support your local neighbors!  Let's face it.  Eating local fresh produce taste better because they spend less time in transit from the farm to you. Some local produce is harvested on the same day you purchase it.  Who said farm-to-able wasn't the best way to enjoy a meal?
		</p>
		<p>
		Buying locally grown produce, you are helping to support the local economy by paying local farmers for their hard work and putting more money into the community.

            <p>
            We are committed to protecting and preserving the Lowcountry by more than love, respect and economy. We are driven by a shared understanding that if we fail to protect these treasured lands, we will not get them back â€“ and something even more important in our culture, economy and environment will also be lost, forever.</p>
<p>
The Lowcountry Open Land Trust is a local land conservation organization that is focused on protecting ecologically, agriculturally, and historically significant Lowcountry lands. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization; contributions from our members may be tax deductible.
