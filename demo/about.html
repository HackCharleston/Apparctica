		Its fresher, better tasting, and helps support your local neighbors!  Lets face it.  Eating local fresh produce taste better because they spend less time in transist making it from the farm to you. Most local produce is harvested on the same day you purchase it.  Who said farm to table wasn’t the best way to enjoy a meal.
		</p>
		<p>
		By buying local, you help support the local economy by paying local farmers for their hard work and putting more money into the community. It’s about togetherness.

            <p>
            We are committed to protecting and preserving the Lowcountry by more than love, respect and economy. We are driven by a shared understanding that if we fail to protect these treasured lands, we will not get them back – and something even more important in our culture, economy and environment will also be lost, forever.</p>
<p>
The Lowcountry Open Land Trust is a local land conservation organization that is focused on protecting ecologically, agriculturally, and historically significant Lowcountry lands. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization; contributions from our members may be tax deductible.
